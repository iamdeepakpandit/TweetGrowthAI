i'm looking for a comprehensive, fully automated AI agent designed to manage and grow a Twitter/X account. The agent should be built with a secure multi-tenant architecture, allowing multiple users to securely connect their accounts and schedule automated posts.

Core Features:
Secure User Authentication: Users must be able to securely connect their Twitter/X accounts. The system should prioritize the secure storage and handling of user credentials, possibly using a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) server for enhanced security.

AI-Powered Content Creation: The agent will use a powerful large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's GPT-4 or a similar API to generate high-quality, engaging, and SEO-friendly tweets.

Content Scheduling: Users should be able to schedule tweets in advance. The interface should be intuitive, allowing for easy scheduling of single tweets, threads, and recurring posts.

Topic-Based Content Generation: Users can select from a variety of predefined topics (e.g., technology, new movies, politics, trending news) or define their own custom topics. The AI will then generate content relevant to these selected areas.

Automated Posting: The agent will automatically post the scheduled and generated content to the user's Twitter/X account at the designated times.

Account Growth Engine: The agent should include features designed to organically grow the user's account. This includes:

Intelligent Hashtag Suggestions: The AI should recommend relevant and trending hashtags to maximize reach.

Engagement Automation (Optional but preferred): The ability to automatically like and retweet relevant content from other users in the same niche.

Follow/Unfollow Automation (Optional but preferred): A feature to intelligently follow users who are likely to be interested in the user's content and unfollow those who don't engage.

Performance Analytics: A user-friendly dashboard that displays key metrics such as follower growth, engagement rates (likes, retweets, replies), and tweet performance.

Technical Requirements:
Frontend: JavaScript, React.js

Backend: Node.js

API Integration: Seamless integration with the Twitter/X API and a chosen LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).

Security: End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data, especially user credentials and API keys.

User Flow:
A new user signs up for the service.

The user securely connects their Twitter/X account.

The user selects their desired content topics and sets a posting schedule.

The AI agent generates a queue of draft tweets based on the user's preferences.

The user can review, edit, or approve the generated tweets.

The agent automatically posts the approved tweets according to the schedule.

The user can track their account's growth and performance through the analytics dashboard.
